# aBlueShaman
WoW Classic Addon that changes Shaman's class color to blue.

## Intro
Just a quick add-on to make shamans' color blue in classic too! Since its name starts with an 'a', it should load before most other addons. In case it doesn't, add `## OptionalDeps: aBlueShaman` to that addon's `.toc` file.

Heads up to [Bouyou](https://www.wowinterface.com/forums/member.php?userid=110013) for his help with the hex color problem!

## Changelog
  * 1.0: Initial upload
  * 1.1: Fixed hex color which was conflicting with WeakAuras2.
